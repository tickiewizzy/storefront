==================
django-attachments
==================

django-attachments is a generic set of template tags to attach any kind of
files to models.

Installation:
=============

1. Put ``attachments`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py``
   within your django project:

   .. code-block:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'attachments',
        )

2. Add the attachments urlpattern to your ``urls.py``:

   .. code-block:: python

        url(r'^attachments/', include('attachments.urls', namespace='attachments')),

3. Migrate your database:

   .. code-block:: shell

        ./manage.py migrate

4. Grant the user some permissions:

   * For **adding attachments** grant the user (or group) the permission
     ``attachments.add_attachment``.

   * For **deleting attachments** grant the user (or group) the permission
     ``attachments.delete_attachment``. This allows the user to delete their
     attachments only.

   * For **deleting foreign attachments** (attachments by other users) grant
     the user the permission ``attachments.delete_foreign_attachments``.

5. Set ``DELETE_ATTACHMENTS_FROM_DISK`` to ``True`` if you want to remove
   files from disk when Attachment objects are removed!

6. Configure ``FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE`` (optional). This is the maximum size in
   bytes before raising form validation errors. If not set there is no restriction
   on file size.

Mind that you serve files!
==========================

django-attachments stores the files in your site_media directory and does not modify
them. For example, if an user uploads a .html file your webserver will probably display
it in HTML. It's a good idea to serve such files as plain text. In a Apache2
configuration this would look like:

.. code-block:: apache

    <Location /site_media/attachments>
        AddType text/plain .html .htm .shtml .php .php5 .php4 .pl .cgi
    </Location>


House-keeping
=============

django-attachments provides the ``delete_stale_attachments`` management command.
It will remove all attachments for which the related objects don't exist anymore!
Sys-admins could then:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./manage.py delete_stale_attachments

You may also want to execute this via cron.


Tests
=====

Run the testsuite in your local environment using ``pipenv``:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ cd django-attachments/
    $ pipenv install --dev
    $ pipenv run pytest attachments/

Or use tox to test against various Django and Python versions:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ tox -r

You can also invoke the test suite or other 'manage.py' commands by calling
the ``django-admin`` tool with the test app settings:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ cd django-attachments/
    $ pipenv install --dev
    $ pipenv run test
    $ pipenv run django-admin.py runserver

Usage:
======

In contrib.admin:
-----------------

django-attachments provides a inline object to add a list of attachments to
any kind of model in your admin app.

Simply add ``AttachmentInlines`` to the admin options of your model. Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib import admin
    from attachments.admin import AttachmentInlines

    class MyEntryOptions(admin.ModelAdmin):
        inlines = (AttachmentInlines,)

.. image:: http://cloud.github.com/downloads/bartTC/django-attachments/attachments_screenshot_admin.png

In your frontend templates:
---------------------------

First of all, load the attachments_tags in every template you want to use it:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load attachments_tags %}

django-attachments comes with some templatetags to add or delete attachments
for your model objects in your frontend.

1. ``get_attachments_for [object]``: Fetches the attachments for the given
   model instance. You can optionally define a variable name in which the attachment
   list is stored in the template context (this is required in Django 1.8). If
   you do not define a variable name, the result is printed instead.

   .. code-block:: html+django

        {% get_attachments_for entry as "attachments_list" %}

2. ``attachments_count [object]``: Counts the attachments for the given
   model instance and returns an int:

   .. code-block:: html+django

        {% attachments_count entry %}

3. ``attachment_form``: Renders a upload form to add attachments for the given
   model instance. Example:

   .. code-block:: html+django

        {% attachment_form [object] %}

   It returns an empty string if the current user is not logged in.

4. ``attachment_delete_link``: Renders a link to the delete view for the given
   *attachment*. Example:

   .. code-block:: html+django

        {% for att in attachments_list %}
            {{ att }} {% attachment_delete_link att %}
        {% endfor %}

   This tag automatically checks for permission. It returns only a html link if the
   give n attachment's creator is the current logged in user or the user has the
   ``delete_foreign_attachments`` permission.

Quick Example:
==============

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% load attachments_tags %}
    {% get_attachments_for entry as my_entry_attachments %}

    <span>Object has {% attachments_count entry %} attachments</span>
    {% if my_entry_attachments %}
    <ul>
    {% for attachment in my_entry_attachments %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ attachment.attachment_file.url }}">{{ attachment.filename }}</a>
            {% attachment_delete_link attachment %}
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}

    {% attachment_form entry %}

    {% if messages %}
    <ul class="messages">
    {% for message in messages %}
        <li{% if message.tags %} class="{{ message.tags }}"{% endif %}>
            {{ message }}
        </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}

  if the attachment model is deleted.

v1.0.1 (2016-06-12):
--------------------

- Added finnish translation.
- Minor test suite improvements.

v1.0 (2016-03-19):
------------------

- General code cleanup to keep compatibility with the latest Django
  (currently 1.8 upwards) as well as Python3. Introduced full testsuite.

- *Backwards incompatible*: The attachment views now use a urlpattern
  ``namespace`` so you need to adjust the urlpattern::

    url(r'^attachments/', include('attachments.urls', namespace='attachments')),

- *Backwards incompatible*: The quotes around the ``as`` variable name
   must be removed::

     {% get_attachments_for entry as "my_entry_attachments" %}

     becomes

     {% get_attachments_for entry as my_entry_attachments %}

- *Possibly backwards incompatible*: The old version had bugs around
   permissions and were not enforcing it in all places. From now on the
   related permissions ``add_attachment`` and ``delete_attachment`` must
   been applied to all related users.

v0.3.1 (2009-07-29):
--------------------

- Added a note to the README that you should secure your static files.

v0.3 (2009-07-22):
------------------

- This version adds more granular control about user permissons. You need
  to explicitly add permissions to users who should been able to upload,
  delete or delete foreign attachments.

  This might be *backwards incompatible* as you did not need to assign
  add/delete permissions before!
